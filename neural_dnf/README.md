# Disentangling Neural Disjunctive Normal Form Models

The script `post_training.py` contains code for our novel disentanglement method
to discretise a trained neural DNF-based model. The content in
`post_training.py` is available now in
[neural-dnf](https://github.com/kittykg/neural-dnf) module from version 2.0.0
onwards.

**IMPORTANT**: The script `post_training.py` is **not** meant to be imported/ran
directly.
