# Disentangling Neural Disjunctive Normal Form Models

The script `post_training.py` contains code for our novel disentanglement method
to discretise a trained neural DNF-based model.

The script `post_training.py` is not meant to be imported/ran directly. Please
add the content in `post_training.py` to your local `neural-dnf` module and
rebuild the package. Link to the full
[neural-dnf](https://github.com/kittykg/neural-dnf) module.
